generate ideas receive feedback as well

23
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,780
as to access information on case studies

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,599
and implementation scenarios

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:26,879
The Forum is open to all users

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:29,219

27
00:01:29,219 --> 00:01:33,239
experience and knowledge of sdmx

28
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,299
in addition to this we will also present

29
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:38,819
ongoing capacity development initiatives

30
00:01:38,819 --> 00:01:42,239
and will engage with you our audience

31
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,478

00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:21,540
prefer you can ask the question yourself

86
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,300
we will then allow you to use microphone

87
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,699
and the camera

88
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,160
to generate a more interactive

89
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,600
atmosphere

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,759
but if you wish we can also ask the

91
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,639
question then for you

93
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,600
being recorded and will be made

available on the global network of data

95
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,899
officers and statisticians at yammer.com

96
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:48,899
unstats

97
00:04:48,899 --> 00:04:52,860
so now I will hand over to sit sit the

98
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,959
floor is now yours please go ahead

99
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,819
your muted yeah I was yeah good morning

100
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,259
good afternoon everyone

101
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,779
uh

102
00:05:17,779 --> 00:05:20,519
this presentation is a quick

103
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:24,060
introduction to sdmx so those of you who

104
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,699
do not know what SDM access or some have

105
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:29,160
some ideas to what SDM access are is

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,860
that this is just a quick overview of

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,740
what is DMX is all about and it's kind

108
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,560
of like

109
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,399
why what and how of sdmx

110
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,160
so going on like data challenges I think

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,680
you're all here in this presentation

112
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,839
because we all deal with data you

113
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,259
exchange data you disseminate data and

114
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:54,779
we bring in data from multiple sources

115
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:57,600
for our everyday work but some of the

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,779
common challenges that we Face are uh

117
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:02,339
when you pull data from different

118
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:04,439
organizations you get data in different

119
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:06,899
file formats you have to deal with

120
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:10,019
different API structure and once you get

121
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,019
the data you have to understand the data

122
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,660
that means you have to read code book

123
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,978
understand what the data is like when

124
00:06:16,978 --> 00:06:18,360
you look at a number which are the

125
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,899
columns that identify the number and you

126
00:06:21,899 --> 00:06:24,779
also run into issues like uh like if you

127
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,300
take two Excel sheet there will be

128
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,038
different column names for the country

129
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:32,879
or the age and

130
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:35,399
was more more importantly also the codes

131
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:38,160
are different so some will have like M

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,139
as male While others will have one as

133
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:43,439
male and fsp mail two spmail so you have

134
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,379
to do a lot of data massaging data

135
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:49,819
jugglery and uh roundabout work

136
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:52,740
workarounds to get data from multiple

137
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:55,139
sources before you can start using this

138
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,959
so all this leads to right like you can

139
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,918
see the details here so

140
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,800
and uh it leads to like a huge mapping

141
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,660
mess

142
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,360
and uh I think it's a problem in most of

143
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,240
the data shops that we have and the

144
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,180
solution is to standardize things so

145
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,060
when you look at uh that the travel

146
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,800
industry when you want to book your

147
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,560
flight ticket doesn't matter which

148
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,740
travel software you use or you call up

149
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,720
the airlines it's always the same

150
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,360
airport code that you booked to from and

151
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,598
to similarly the airline the the flight

152
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:35,339
that you fly in has got the same flight

153
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,800
number and it doesn't matter from which

154
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,360
corner of the world you're buying or

155
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,699
from brick system you're buying you

156
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,800
always end up in the airport that you

157
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,959
want to similarly when you trade on the

158
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,379
stock exchange like you doesn't matter

159
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,379
which brokerage you use you or which

160
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:55,199
software nowadays which app you use you

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,478
you can always buy yours the stock that

162
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:00,240
you want one of the most successful

163
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,620
standards is HTML where we can see where

164
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:06,360
you create a website and it doesn't

165
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,519
matter which operating system you are in

166
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:10,918
which web browser you are in you are

167
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:13,918
able to see the web page so sdmx is a

168
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:15,839
similar initiative sponsored by seven

169
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:18,000
International agencies to solve the

170
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,579
problem to of exchange of statistical

171
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,220
data and metadata

172
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,639
so now coming to the what what is sdmx

173
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,339
sdmx is an open standard for data and

174
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:31,620
metadata exchange and when you say an

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,538
open standard it is both for the

176
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:36,120
technical standards so which is kind of

177
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,599
your apis and the content standard so it

178
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,179
tries to have standardize both the

179
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,219
content that we get is exchanged and

180
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,799
also the way which machine to machine

181
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:49,919
communicate more importantly sdmx has

182
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:53,700
got a data and metadata modeling so when

183
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,039
you exchange your data not only you make

184
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,379
your data available via an API it also

185
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,820
helps users to understand uh the data

186
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,559
that they are consuming without having

187
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,980
to read too much of a code book like

188
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,480
assess if you are a programmer you will

189
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,159
be able to figure out okay which are the

190
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:13,559
columns which are not null which are the

191
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:16,259
columns which may be null and which are

192
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:18,299
the primary keys to identify the data

193
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:20,639
those kind of information you get so all

194
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,379
in all it enables machine to machine

195
00:09:22,379 --> 00:09:25,919
coming community education and since its

196
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,440
Inception way back in the early 2000s it

197
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,259
has always been based on supporting open

198
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,659
source standard ID tools so it is like

199
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:36,539
you create a tool once and everybody can

200
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,379
they use the same tool

201
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,379
so ldmx has got three major components

202
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:44,940
this is going a little bit into the

203
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:48,778
weeds but it's still a 50 000 view uh 50

204
00:09:48,778 --> 00:09:50,940
000 feet view so it's got the technical

205
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,220
specification which defines how the API

206
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,799
should be and other details around that

207
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,740
the data exchange mechanism then you

208
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,419
have the content oriented guideline

209
00:10:00,419 --> 00:10:03,659
which tries to harmonize your content so

210
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:06,259
something like everybody calls country

211
00:10:06,259 --> 00:10:10,259
with the same set of column names or age

212
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:13,980
or sex or everything else and here and

213
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,958
then there is a glossary created so that

214
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,299
we all speak the same line the same

215
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,639
language a good example is like when you

216
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:22,559
say football it's got a different

217
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:24,778
meaning in North America as opposed to

218
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:27,240
in the European continent or same thing

219
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,039
with a trolley with trolley in the US

220
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,019
and the UK means totally two different

221
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:33,179
things so the idea of the glossary is

222
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:35,580
like when we say a particular word if we

223
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,320
are all implementing as DMX we are all

224
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,120
speaking the same language and there is

225
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,539
no nothing last translation and the last

226
00:10:42,539 --> 00:10:44,578
empire and the most important which I

227
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,578
think all of you should be

228
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,320
focused on is the tools the open source

229
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,480
tools there are like lots and lots of

230
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,299
tools available in sdmx and you can get

231
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:57,659
a lot of information on the HDMX website

232
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,440
so here is an example of how sdmx makes

233
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,419
life simple especially those of you who

234
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,159
are developers who are trying to pull

235
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:08,639
data from multiple apis and you end up

236
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:12,120
with writing like five or ten different

237
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,919
set of codes depending on the number of

238
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:15,839
organizations from which you're trying

239
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,778
to pull whereas with sdmx if you see the

240
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:21,958
call structures are all standardized so

241
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,720
all you need to change is the domain

242
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,059
from which you're pulling the data but

243
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:30,419
the rest of the process remains uh a

244
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:32,700
standard so once once you write a code

245
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,740
if you have to add a new organization

246
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,720
that says DMX compliant it's very easy

247
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,399
you just add in the configuration what

248
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:39,958
will your domain is and what the new

249
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:42,120
initial call structure is and you're

250
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,159
good to go

251
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,419
uh

252
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:48,659
sorry am I going back

253
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:51,240
uh content oriented guidelines so as I'm

254
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,019
as I said this is trying to like

255
00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:57,480
harmonize the kind of data that we

256
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,879
exchange so everybody calls frequency is

257
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:02,339
a particular thing age in a particular

258
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:05,759
way and when you look at statistical

259
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:07,980
data unlike the travel industry or the

260
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,078
financial industry which had given it is

261
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,360
spread across multiple domains so you've

262
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,100
got like national accounts you've got

263
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,620
social you've got many other

264
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,120
things so so we are kind of uh using the

265
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,958
unece classification for uh defining the

266
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,320
various domains uh and then the cross

267
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,419
domain code list so this is more like

268
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:32,940
when you exchange codes like when you're

269
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,980
exchanging something like frequency so

270
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:38,278
everybody says agrees on a is annual Ms

271
00:12:38,278 --> 00:12:41,578
monthly D is daily Etc so in this way we

272
00:12:41,578 --> 00:12:45,179
eliminate a lot of mapping of data when

273
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:47,159
we exchange data and it becomes much

274
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,278
more seamless exchange of data so here's

275
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:52,078
a quick example of a cross domain

276
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:54,419
concept something like your which

277
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:56,578
repeats across statistical domains like

278
00:12:56,578 --> 00:12:58,620
your frequency of data like whether it

279
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,120
is monthly data whether it is annual

280
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,759
data reference area is what we use for

281
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:05,339
country or region or sub-national and

282
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,799
whether the data is comparable or not so

283
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,720
if you see on the right you can see some

284
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,299
of the code harmonization for the

285
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,778
frequency code list

286
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,399
want to go into the details of this but

287
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,639
this is something which the sdmx group

288
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,679
takes care of so when you're drafting

289
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,059
you just take these code lists and

290
00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:25,440
implement it

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,299
here is an example of the statistical

292
00:13:27,299 --> 00:13:28,980
subject matter domain so you've got

293
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,720
demographic and social statistics

294
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,519
economic statistics

295
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,860
environment and multi-domain statistics

296
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,320
within them you got further subdivisions

297
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,958
but to a large extent this helps us

298
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,860
guide create domain specific code lists

299
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,799
and Concepts and also cross domain code

300
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,720
list and Concepts

301
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,778
now if you have to implement sdmx you

302
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:53,220
are a statistician and you want to

303
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:55,259
implement as DMX like many of these

304
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:58,740
terms like code list and Concepts may be

305
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,500
a bit uh

306
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,480
overwhelming but essentially all that

307
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,299
you need to do as a statistician in your

308
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:09,240
organization is to understand your own

309
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:13,379
data and provide to the

310
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:16,320
team implementing is DMX how to

311
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,539
interpret your data so here is an

312
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:21,600
example of an external data and as a

313
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,458
statistician all that you need to do is

314
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:28,200
say that okay country stock flow time

315
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,100
and the topic are necessary to identify

316
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,519
the observation out there like and if

317
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,320
you look at other things like unit

318
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,679
multiplier and unit uh these are needed

319
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,778
to further qualify your data so

320
00:14:42,778 --> 00:14:44,940
essentially that's what you do and then

321
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,839
the team implementing is DMX and we have

322
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:50,399
a lot of capacity building activities

323
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,379
which my colleagues will be talking

324
00:14:52,379 --> 00:14:55,078
later on will help you to adapt it but

325
00:14:55,078 --> 00:14:56,639
once you adopt it then your data

326
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,980
exchange with other organizations and

327
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,379
even within your own Community will

328
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:04,320
become much more seamless and faster

329
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,958
so some of the key benefits of SDM

330
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,659
access it's an open internationally

331
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:12,299
agreed standard for exchange so as I

332
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:15,419
pointed out in the example of the data

333
00:15:15,419 --> 00:15:18,000
API calls that you make it becomes very

334
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,578
simple and because the content is

335
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:22,139
standardized you don't have to do too

336
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,899
much of data massaging before you can

337
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:28,198
start using it so it's syntactic and

338
00:15:28,198 --> 00:15:31,320
semantic interoperable so more like it

339
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,299
is more like when you pull a data not

340
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:35,759
only you get the data but you also are

341
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,980
able to get enough information as to how

342
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,919
to interpret the data as DMX is built on

343
00:15:40,919 --> 00:15:42,659
the principle of reusable open source

344
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:44,698
tools so you don't have to invest a lot

345
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:47,820
of time and money into building tools uh

346
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,039
it does harmonization of statistical

347
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:51,659
Concepts and codes which I've been

348
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,519
talking about more importantly

349
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,339
versioning is very strong in sdmx so if

350
00:15:56,339 --> 00:15:58,198
you want to maintain data versions you

351
00:15:58,198 --> 00:15:59,940
have to maintain your technical standard

352
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,458
versions as the MX provides you a lot

353
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,679
and it helps you to have like if you

354
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:06,480
want to go back in time to see how your

355
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,778
data was it helps you a lot and all in

356
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:11,278
all it helps you to have timely

357
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:13,259
collection and dissemination of data and

358
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:15,480
metadata efficiently

359
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,259
thank you

360
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,399
thank you Sid for for this overview

361
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,100
before we continue with the next section

362
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,320
which is basically an introduction to

363
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,179
the semx user Forum I would like to ask

364
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:38,399
all participants to answer this little

365
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,740
question so what do you use sdmx for and

366
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,899
then you can choose between data

367
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:48,600
modeling processing integration data

368
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,078
dissemination data reporting or you can

369
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,379
say we do not use semx at the moment and

370
00:16:55,379 --> 00:16:58,980
that you are exploring to use sdmx in

371
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,120
the future

372
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,039
so maybe

373
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:04,919

00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:43,079
will start now uh with my section

405
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:46,679
presenting the stmx user form I will

406
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:48,558
share my screen

407
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:50,279
and

408
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:50,819
um

409
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:54,779
I hope you can see it now

410
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,058
so

411
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,519
I will give a short introduction to the

412
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,519
scmx user Forum in the next 10 minutes

413
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:06,298
so what what is the sdmx user for

414
00:19:06,298 --> 00:19:09,960
so the semx user forum is an open and

415
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,480
inclusive online community to connect

416
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,500
and share knowledge on SDM X it's a

417
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,740
forum where you can ask questions

418
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,440
you can find answers to those questions

419
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,440
or you can provide it answers yourself

420
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,019
to questions which you think

421
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:33,900
you you can contribute something to them

422
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,240
you can also connect with experts in

423
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,038
peers from around the globe who work on

424
00:19:40,038 --> 00:19:43,440
sdmx or with sdmx

425
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,220
the sdmx user forum is is hosted on the

426
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,380
global network of data offices and

427
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,940
statisticians

428
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,919
and because we are working with numbers

429
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:55,640
let me give you a few numbers

430
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,538
about the SMX user Forum so The Forum

431
00:20:00,538 --> 00:20:04,980
has currently more than 250 members

432
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,000
the ratio of monthly active uses to the

433
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,660
total number of members of The Forum is

434
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,599
about 70 which is a very good value and

435
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:17,160
shows how active

436
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:21,419
the The Forum actually is

437
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,298
since the launch there were more than

438
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:27,359
120 messages posted and those messages

439
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:32,719
were read on average more than 70 times

440
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:36,298
so and what kind of questions would you

441
00:20:36,298 --> 00:20:39,900
find on the sa Max use of arms so so far

442
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,919
they had in

443
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:47,160
1717 questions asked all were answered

444
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,220
in less than 48 hours usually it's

445
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,339
within a day but

446
00:20:53,339 --> 00:20:57,538
so for sure within 48 hours

447
00:20:57,538 --> 00:21:00,000
you will see here on the screen the

448
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,640
topics uh

449
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,619
uh

450
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:06,660
with which those questions were

451
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,359
classified

452
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,720
and some of the popular topics were sdmx

453
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,058
modeling

454
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:18,259
vtl and also

455
00:21:18,259 --> 00:21:22,380
things like SC questions about semx in

456
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,558
general

457
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:28,440
I would like now to show you

458
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,599
the

459
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,779
stmx user Forum live so and I want to

460
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:35,819
show you also three examples of

461
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:39,119
questions so the first one

462
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,259
is on

463
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,440
sdmx sorry

464
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,259
let me switch to my other browser

465
00:21:52,259 --> 00:21:54,859
okay

466
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:59,279
so the first one

467
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,359
is on

468
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:06,720
stmx modeling and so there was a

469
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,179
question about the attributes in a

470
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:12,839
typical DSD of sdmx so this is a

471
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,679
question posted by Dimitris uh posted

472
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,419
yesterday actually

473
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:21,538
and you can see at the bottom so several

474
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:24,000
people have already answered so Stratos

475
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,640
have provided an answer and Abdullah has

476
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,099
added on to that

477
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,359
you can also see that the question the

478
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,779
answer by Stratos was marked by the by

479
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:39,779
Dimitris as the best answer so this

480
00:22:39,779 --> 00:22:42,960
functionality of showing the or taking

481
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,538
the best answer is something that the

482
00:22:45,538 --> 00:22:47,579
person who is asking the question can do

483
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,380
or a moderator

484
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,919
so this is just one example

485
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,279
then we have for instance a question

486
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:59,460
about vtl

487
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,339
and

488
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,679
yeah here's a this was a question by

489
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:08,400
Nicholas posted earlier this month

490
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,079
where he has provided also some

491
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:16,798
data as an example

492
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,880
and you can also see that several people

493
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,880
have answered and then Nicholas has

494
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,980
reacted to it

495
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,919
so this is more or less the way it looks

496
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,679
yeah when you ask a question and what

497
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,419
will happen

498
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:36,538
so let me explain also how to join the

499
00:23:36,538 --> 00:23:39,538
global Network and the scmx user Forum

500
00:23:39,538 --> 00:23:42,960
very quickly so for that I will open an

501
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,179
incognito window just because I'm

502
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:47,298
already locked into

503
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:50,220
the um

504
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,500
Global Network so you would go to

505
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,140
yammer.com

506
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,058
you instead

507
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:00,359
all right and when you do that you would

508
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:02,460
see a screen like this

509
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,640
and you would provide your

510
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,240
email address

511
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,179
and preferably you would use your

512
00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:15,119
work email address and then once you hit

513
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:17,839
sign up you will receive an email

514
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,179
and then there are like two steps more

515
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:24,119
which you need to do to basically finish

516
00:24:24,119 --> 00:24:27,619
the sign up process

517
00:24:27,619 --> 00:24:31,140
okay so this is how to join the global

518
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:35,099
Network and then let me maybe explain a

519
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,558
little bit more how to get there so

520
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:39,000
let's say you have joined the global

521
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,579
network but you don't know where to find

522
00:24:41,579 --> 00:24:43,798
the sdmax user forum

523
00:24:43,798 --> 00:24:46,919
in that case you can just type sdmx here

524
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,058
on the top left in the uh in the search

525
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:54,058
and the first hit should be the sdmx

526
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:55,558
user forum

527
00:24:55,558 --> 00:24:57,839
there are two more groups related to

528
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,599
sdmx but which are private one is a

529
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:03,000
coordination group for the sdmax user

530
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,940
firm and the other one is a group bought

531
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,640
the preparation of the sdmx conference

532
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,940
so those are not public but the SMX user

533
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,159
form is open to everyone so what you

534
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,259
will see in the middle here is basically

535
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:18,599
the feed with the questions and answers

536
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:19,859
right

537
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:22,558
on the right hand side you will see some

538
00:25:22,558 --> 00:25:25,740
more information about The Forum and

539
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,778
popular topics and also some

540
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:33,359
documents with uh additional information

541
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,778
about like the standard set of topics

542
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:39,298
and the usage policy

543
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:42,179
okay so and if you want to ask a

544
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:45,079
question then in the samx user Forum

545
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,179
that would happen here in the middle

546
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:52,380
at the top so there's several types of

547
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,038
posts you would choose a question pose

548
00:25:55,038 --> 00:26:00,058
and say so this is my question right and

549
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:03,200
and you write a little bit there

550
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,119
for uh and explaining what your question

551
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:11,819
is you can also use bold face and italic

552
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:14,819
face if you want to you can uh

553
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:18,778
link to a web page if you want to

554
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:21,778
which I will not do now you can also

555
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:24,720
upload a file from your computer if you

556
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,940
want to by clicking on this and then you

557
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:30,778
select the file and you open it it will

558
00:26:30,778 --> 00:26:33,119
be added to your question

559
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:36,119
please don't share any confidential

560
00:26:36,119 --> 00:26:38,298
information because

561
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:42,319
you don't want to expose any individual

562
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:46,019
data of anyone

563
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,559
so once you have asked the question

564
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:49,980
[Music]

565
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,298
um

566
00:26:51,298 --> 00:26:53,640
people can reply to a question like this

567
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,579
question by Dimitris you can click on

568
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:01,859
reply and I could then add

569
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:06,839
answer the question by Dimitris uh

570
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,359
providing an answer and posting it and

571
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,179
it will be visible to everyone

572
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,880
and then if I don't want to rep

573
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,819
ly to Dimitri's original question but

574
00:27:17,819 --> 00:27:22,380
maybe to let us answer I can click reply

575
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,519
there

576
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,220
and if I scroll down you will see okay

577
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,558
now it says Alexander logic is replying

578
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,980
to Stratos right and so it becomes clear

579
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,880
to whom you are replying to

580
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,460
so this is a little bit an overview of

581
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,159
the sdmx user Forum

582
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,220
um I cannot go in to all the details I

583
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,259
just want to mention a couple of things

584
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,480
more and for that I will go back to my

585
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,759

we all know what hit is three years ago

718
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,918
in 2020 when we went into lockdown and

719
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,159
the in-person training became a luxury

720
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,460
unachievable luxury

721
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,199
so since the pandemic started for the

722
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:00,780
last three years e-learning courses have

723
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,760
increasingly become a focus

724
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,880
and we will talk about some of them now

725
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:11,960

is why after the you know

751
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:19,139
the course closed it ceased to be

752
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:20,400
available

753
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,179
however now that

754
00:36:24,179 --> 00:36:25,320
um

755
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,019
the sdmx user forum is up and dreading

756
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,480
support for that training course is

757
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
provided through the sdmx user forum and

758
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,159
therefore the Asian development Bank

759
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,300
kindly

760
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:40,019
uh made this training available on a

761
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:41,400
permanent basis

762
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,199
about a month ago

763
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,940
so

764
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:50,159
the module the training consists of two

765
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:53,880
modules module one is an overview and

766
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,920
business case which is important for

767
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,000
both

768
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,980
um

769
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,280
managers those who are trying to

770
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,380
understand how sdmx can help the

771
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,559
Enterprise but also technical experts to

772
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,599
understand what the business case is and

773
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,719
basically also how how to use the stmx

774
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:14,880
and module two

775
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,380
is

776
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,780
um

777
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,460
oriented towards the technical experts

778
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,099
and it does give an introduction you

779
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,159
know the introduction to the basic

780
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:29,059
concepts of sdmx with the information

781
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:31,619
the basics of the information model the

782
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:33,780
candid oriented guidelines and and

783
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,099
others

784
00:37:35,099 --> 00:37:36,420
so

785
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,559
um

786
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,858
the course had a very high attendance

787
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,239
last year

788
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:45,539
over 400 people I think about 430 people

789
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,338
completed the course and received the

790
00:37:47,338 --> 00:37:48,838
certificate

791
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,599
and now it is available

792
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:52,800
um

793
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,460
on a permanent basis so if you would

794
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,060
like to

795
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,000
learn if you are have heard about sdmx

796
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,838
but

797
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:06,780
don't really know what it is and how to

798
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,059
use it what it can be used for

799
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,338
then I think that this training can be

800
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:13,999
very helpful

801
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:16,199
another training course

802
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,500
um I wanted to introduce is the a

803
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,960
training course on sdmx for sdg

804
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,000
indicators

805
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,199
it was developed by unsd and the um

806
00:38:28,199 --> 00:38:31,199
working group on SDM on sdmx for the for

807
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,019
sdg indicators and its objective is to

808
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:35,519
support the data exchange and

809
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:37,858
dissemination of a sustainable

810
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:41,179
development goals indicators

811
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,280
um

812
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,380
this e-learning course is um

813
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,480
intended for those who already have a

814
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,358
basic knowledge as DMX of sdmx and would

815
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,300
like to learn how to use the sdg data

816
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,559
structure definition and how to

817
00:38:58,559 --> 00:39:01,019
establish LG data exchange and

818
00:39:01,019 --> 00:39:03,599
dissemination

819
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,300
um so there is a prerequisite unlike the

820
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,219
previous one there is a prerequisite I

821
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:10,440
mean there is a prerequisite for this

822
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,380
training is a basic knowledge of sdmx

823
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,719
and uh

824
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:18,900
it is advisable that you take the sdmx

825
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,059
foundation course before taking the

826
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,000
training on sdmx for the sdgs so that to

827
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,880
familiarize yourself with the basic um

828
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
um

829
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,079
knowledge and in the tech wire a basic

830
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,459
understanding of sdmx

831
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,380
um the registration link is here it will

832
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,358
be announced at the sdmx user Forum

833
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,300
today so if you join the user Forum

834
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,460
today which are very much encouraged to

835
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,260
this is probably the first thing that

836
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,679
you will see

837
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,719
I will not go in detail about the dot

838
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,159
stat Academy learning courses because

839
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:56,219
Jonathan whose presentation is after

841
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,358
detail but that's that Academy is

842
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:03,000
growing very rapidly it has two learning

843

available are introduction to estimates

846
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,559
for data producers technical expert

847
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,460
studies

848
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:14,579
and the other one is Introduction to

849
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,239
sdmi structural modeling both very

850
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:19,320
useful and very important training

851
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,179
courses

852
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:23,639

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,338
commonly used and sdmx tools and it's

865
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:55,320
working the the development is led by

866
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,519
the Asian development Bank in

867
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:59,099
cooperation with unsd ILO as cap and

868
00:40:59,099 --> 00:41:02,639
Capp and other agencies those which are

869
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,559
which develop the tools

870
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,780
creation development backend you and SD

871
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:10,858
are also planning to develop later the

872
00:41:10,858 --> 00:41:12,480
main specific learning course so we have

873
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,219
now won the main specific learning

874
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:17,338
course on sdmax for the sdgs but we're

875
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:19,380
also going to um Aviation Development

876
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,719
Bank with you know in cooperation with

877
00:41:21,719 --> 00:41:24,539
unsd are also going to develop you know

878
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,679

available and then you have the choice

901
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,099
between data modeling data processing

902
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:36,719
and integration

903
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,420

00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,239
okay so hopefully you can see my

942
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:47,780
presentation and you can name it yes and

943
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,679
hopefully we're not going to have any

944
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,639
more technical issues on my side uh so

945
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,079
yeah so thank you uh for that and um

946
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,239
um I think it's quite timely we've

947
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,920
discussed this also because it seemed

948
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,559
like a vast number of people majority of

949
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:05,219
people

950
00:45:05,219 --> 00:45:07,679
aren't actually or haven't taken courses

951
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,019
recently so

952
00:45:10,019 --> 00:45:12,838
um and there is interest

953
00:45:12,838 --> 00:45:15,000
um Abdullah did present a number of

954
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,079
these so I I will my presentation will

955
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:22,380
look at one particular initiative in

956
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,960
um focus on the dot stat Academy

957
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,579
um and also touched on a few other

958
00:45:26,579 --> 00:45:28,318
initiatives from other organizations

959
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:30,000
that uh

960
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,900
um that are conducting estimates courses

961
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:36,000
um so

962
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,019
yeah so what is the Dutch Academy so um

963
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,739
the dot set Academy is a

964
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,300
self-paced online Learning Hub it's

965
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,119
providing today free online training and

966
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,579
resources to support capacity building

967
00:45:50,579 --> 00:45:53,358
in the dotset Suites

968
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,599
but also which is a topic of the day XD

969
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,300
mix and data modeling for data producers

970
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,699
and data toolers so data tool as being

971
00:46:02,699 --> 00:46:05,280
the technologists

972
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,800
um so who's behind this so the state

973
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:09,900
academy is initiative from the sacc so

974
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,659
this is a um Alex introduced us at the

975
00:46:12,659 --> 00:46:14,579
beginning these disco information system

976
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:16,739
collaboration Community uh this is a

977
00:46:16,739 --> 00:46:18,300
group of organizations that is

978
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:22,019
collaborating together since around 2010

979
00:46:22,019 --> 00:46:23,818
um and having now grown to 16 members

980
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:25,380
you can see these members on screen so

981
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,960
quite diverse across a range of

982
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:30,719
statistical producing organizations from

983
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:33,900
International rational and central banks

984
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,260
and really our focus is on on delivering

985
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,059
Concrete Solutions to common problems

986
00:46:39,059 --> 00:46:42,300
and this includes driving forward XNX

987
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,519
implementation

988
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:44,760
[Music]

989
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,400
the Workwear number of Partners so in

990
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:50,219
our Partnerships that we build we are

991
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:52,559
supporting standardization as I

992
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,719
mentioned in XT Max tools data modeling

993
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:57,179
and capacity development including some

994
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:00,239
of those Partners on the call today

995
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:02,579
um so the Dutch Academy is

996
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:05,460
um uh supporting learning paths and

997
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:07,380
trading needs as I mentioned data

998
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:09,659
producers and data toolers so data

999
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,000
produces the ones producing and managing

1000
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,119
the data process uh modeling

1001
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,159
um you know processing of the data and

1002
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,440
dissemination of the data

1003
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,920
um the content is really designed to be

1004
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,219
engaging uh and and be more practical so

1005
00:47:26,219 --> 00:47:29,460
really sort of uh aligns to how you

1006
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,800
would apply this in the real world with

1007
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:34,199
real world scenarios and quiz based

1008
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:37,019
activities and interactive exercises

1009
00:47:37,019 --> 00:47:39,179
the learning levels are designed also to

1010
00:47:39,179 --> 00:47:40,739
sort of build your Knowledge and Skills

1011
00:47:40,739 --> 00:47:42,559
over time so you have this sort of uh

1012
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,019
goal if you want that you want to reach

1013
00:47:46,019 --> 00:47:48,059
um and the the idea and the way that the

1014
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:50,219
courses are designed and

1015
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:53,760
structured is really to help you reach

1016
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,800
that goal uh whatever that my goal might

1017
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,780
be

1018
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,800
um just uh to sort of uh quote Alex also

1019
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,599
as as we are uh statistical

1020
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:05,039
organizations we do like numbers so

1021
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:07,380
here's a few numbers from the academy

1022
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:10,318
um so today we have uh we're just over a

1023
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:11,099
year

1024
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:13,739
um old on this and we have a 275

1025
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:16,980
registered users uh 360 enrolled in in

1026
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,659
across the different courses that we

1027
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:19,920
have

1028
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,440
um and today we have uh close to 180

1029
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:26,280
certified Learners and we have a number

1030
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,500
of resources uh around 100 resources

1031
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,838
this isn't just courses this is also a

1032
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:34,159
documents and um and materials videos

1033
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:36,358
webinars and things like this that we

1034
00:48:36,358 --> 00:48:39,438
have online as well

1035
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:43,500
um so today there are two uh courses

1036
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,139
that are related to XD mix and and data

1037
00:48:46,139 --> 00:48:48,000
modeling so we have this introduction

1038
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,559
course to actually mixed with data

1039
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:52,318
producers this is really the basics so

1040
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:54,900
if you're if you're looking to uh learn

1041
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,480
about XNX for the first time or maybe

1042
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,539
you just want a refresher or to sort of

1043
00:49:00,539 --> 00:49:02,460
really understand a bit more about the

1044
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,318
business case and the

1045
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,300
um and how economics is structured

1046
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,420
building also on aspects that um Sid

1047
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,579
introduced at the beginning this course

1048
00:49:11,579 --> 00:49:14,460
is really for you so start here and it's

1049
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,900
also a prerequisite for the second

1050
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:18,900
course which is uh the introduction to

1051
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,880
academic structure modeling for data

1052
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:23,940
producers so this course is a course

1053
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,559
that would guide you through step by

1054
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:26,400
step

1055
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,739
modeling process it uses a tool called

1056
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:31,559
The xmx Matrix generator this is an

1057
00:49:31,559 --> 00:49:32,780
Excel

1058
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,579
macro workbook that really guides you

1059
00:49:35,579 --> 00:49:37,199
through that process helps you every

1060
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,920
step of the way and will you know really

1061
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,318
cover those elements to to get you into

1062
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:45,179
the modeling and start to apply that

1063
00:49:45,179 --> 00:49:47,838
more practically in your daily work

1064
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:50,639
and so yeah this this course is all

1065
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:53,699
freely available these were authored by

1066
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,699
David baraklaf who is uh chair of the

1067
00:49:56,699 --> 00:50:01,260
swg xmx as disc working group and also

1068
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,500
leads the oecd modeling and migration

1069
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:10,578
work on xdmx and data at UIC do

1070
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:13,559
um also a nice thing at the end of it

1071
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:15,838
you will get certificate of completion

1072
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:18,780
so just to say thank you for taking the

1073
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:21,838
course and and to show that you've

1074
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:24,179
actually completed it um and and this is

1075
00:50:24,179 --> 00:50:25,500
available at the end once you've

1076
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,739
completed all modules and passed

1077
00:50:28,739 --> 00:50:30,838
um Abdullah touched on this also in his

1078
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:33,119
presentation so we we do have some

1079
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,699
courses that are are coming uh this year

1080
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,099
uh we have a vocabulary course actually

1081
00:50:38,099 --> 00:50:39,900
split into two parts

1082
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,880
um uh the first one is really a

1083
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:44,219
beginners so it's it's touching on the

1084
00:50:44,219 --> 00:50:48,300
the terms that are used within uh xdmx

1085
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,559
that you need to understand uh to Define

1086
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:55,800
your tables and the related processes

1087
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,838
and then we have a second course which

1088
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:00,480
will build on this for those who really

1089
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,599
uh want to go further in their

1090
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:06,659
understanding of academics terms um and

1091
00:51:06,659 --> 00:51:08,880
we'll start to touch on things such as

1092
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:12,300
in reference romance data and and more

1093
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,099
um we also have a very important course

1094
00:51:14,099 --> 00:51:16,199
that's coming later this year which is

1095
00:51:16,199 --> 00:51:18,960
about optimizing the user experience

1096
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,519
um it's very important to understand

1097
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:23,159
that data modeling is just an XD mix is

1098
00:51:23,159 --> 00:51:25,318
not just about exchange of data but it

1099
00:51:25,318 --> 00:51:27,300
can drive the dissemination and we saw

1100
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,818
that also in some responses the way

1101
00:51:29,818 --> 00:51:31,679
people are using X makes the day into

1102
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,539
simulation and it's very important to

1103
00:51:33,539 --> 00:51:35,280
understand that your modeling decisions

1104
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:37,739
also have implications for how the user

1105
00:51:37,739 --> 00:51:39,059
consumes your data and how it's

1106
00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:41,159
presented in in your dissemination

1107
00:51:41,159 --> 00:51:42,260
environment

1108
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:45,719
so for example in the dots test Suite in

1109
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,519
the data explorer that we component we

1110
00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:51,000
have is very much xmx driven so how you

1111
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,159
design how you constraint you know you

1112
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:55,139
build your data views this is very

1113
00:51:55,139 --> 00:51:56,818
important to consider during that

1114
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:58,858
process and this course will actually

1115
00:51:58,858 --> 00:52:02,480
allow and and give you the skills and

1116
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,219
knowledge to be able to do that in a

1117
00:52:05,219 --> 00:52:06,838
confident manner

1118
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:09,719
a few courses that are in the pipeline

1119
00:52:09,719 --> 00:52:13,619
but they're not there yet and this these

1120
00:52:13,619 --> 00:52:15,960
these have no set date but

1121
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,420
um we're discussing internally about the

1122
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,280
courses around reference and metadata

1123
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,679
unit of measure which is also an

1124
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:25,619
important topic and quite complex and

1125
00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:27,838
structural metadata governance so this

1126
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:29,880
is also an important topic it's not

1127
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:31,800
necessarily related to the modding the

1128
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:34,318
next mix itself but it's uh it's very

1129
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:37,380
important how you set up your governance

1130
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,079
to support this work and modeling work

1131
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,119
within your organization especially when

1132
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,059
we think about harmonization and

1133
00:52:44,059 --> 00:52:46,920
building sort of common elements such as

1134
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:48,599
common code lists across your

1135
00:52:48,599 --> 00:52:49,139
organization

1136
00:52:49,139 --> 00:52:50,338
[Music]

1137
00:52:50,338 --> 00:52:53,099
there are a couple other courses that uh

1138
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:56,039
uh can mention from different partners

1139
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,019
that we work with also you're a staff

1140
00:52:58,019 --> 00:52:59,639

and find out more and there is many more

1151
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:26,699
we've probably not mentioned today

1152
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:30,719
um and in fact this is a a initiative

1153
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:33,480
this year in the extreme Secretariat to

1154
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:36,539
gather all uh information related to the

1155
00:53:36,539 --> 00:53:39,179
xmx courses and trainings that are going

1156
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:43,199
on across all the organizations and to

1157
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,480
bring that together and and to sort of

1158
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:47,400
try to build a more

1159
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,219
um sort of coordinated effort and

1160
00:53:49,219 --> 00:53:53,519
listing of these courses

1161
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:55,500
this leads me to my next slide which is

1162
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,179
around you know what what about an

1163
00:53:57,179 --> 00:53:59,579
Easter makes academy uh you know each

1164
00:53:59,579 --> 00:54:02,099
organization is producing nice courses

1165
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,699
and there are many things going on uh so

1166
00:54:05,699 --> 00:54:07,380
we need to think about how we bring this

1167
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,639
together and this is something as I

1168
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,099
mentioned we're looking at doing

1169
00:54:11,099 --> 00:54:14,519
um and and building on the expertise we

1170
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:16,980
have for example like the xmx user forum

1171
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:18,659
is Alex presented today is a very

1172
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:20,159
important initiative where we're

1173
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,219
allowing uh you know enabling access to

1174
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,800
experts to respond

1175
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,960
um how can we build on that how can we

1176
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,420
also build uh you know on the existing

1177
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,940
trainings and aggregate those in a way

1178
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:36,000
that's more easier to to access for for

1179
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,500
users

1180
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,440
um so yeah this will more to come on

1181
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:43,559
this and uh between now and then uh

1182
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:46,380
there'll be more engagement with the

1183
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,659
community and and also gathering

1184
00:54:48,659 --> 00:54:52,260
information to to report back and also

1185
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,280
have

1186
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,019
um very likely the global conference

1187
00:54:57,019 --> 00:54:59,280
capacity building or capacity

1188
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,159
development activities that will take

1189
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:04,139
place it will take place in the later

1190
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,838

00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,980
uh I just want to say that uh you know

00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:01,619
uh has that any any documentation

1231
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,880
requests coming from the community

1232
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,880
because uh we we have been having a lot

1233
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,179
of API upgrades actually per version so

1234
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:12,059
are we pointing out Deltas you know a

1235
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:13,440
point one has this particular thing

1236
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:15,119
point two has this particular thing and

1237
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,920
you have to give back Port supporting

1238
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:18,900
that sort of situation uh this is

1239
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,659
basically a software level uh on a

1240
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:23,579
research basis I wanted to know like you

1241
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,858
know are we giving you know a graphical

1242
00:57:25,858 --> 00:57:27,838
interface like you know Swagger has this

1243
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:29,219
particular interface but doesn't have a

1244
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:31,500
documentation so it becomes really

1245
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,780
difficult for the gentleman who is

1246
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:35,880

either

1310
01:00:29,179 --> 01:00:32,219
preferably on the global Network as the

1311
01:00:32,219 --> 01:00:34,619
question there we will share the slides

1312
01:00:34,619 --> 01:00:38,760
and the recording there if you have

1313
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:42,059
um issues with joining the global

1314
01:00:42,059 --> 01:00:44,880
Network please let us know that normally

1315
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,838
it's a relative really smooth experience

1316
01:00:48,838 --> 01:00:51,539
but in some isolated cases there can be

1317
01:00:51,539 --> 01:00:53,760
issues so please reach out we don't want

1318
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,818
to lose anyone on the way

1319
01:00:56,818 --> 01:00:58,260

1320
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,280

1321
01:01:02,280 --> 01:01:04,619
questions so this could be a very good

1322
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,659
sign means that we covered everything

1323
01:01:06,659 --> 01:01:09,599
